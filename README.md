This is the archive of the original links to download the original version of Black Mesa (from 2012) with it's official HTML Download Manager.
Only the remaining one active are available here, most of the original site are all taken down for many years for various reasons.

The Following mirrors are available: <s>GameFront</s>, ModDB, Torrent, Chip.de

GameFront links are available but the website has been redesigned, which ended up breaking the links. Instead of giving you the actual game, it's give you a map for the original HL instead.
